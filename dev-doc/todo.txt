Introduction to the data exchange between the web applications of TA portal and certain institutes
 
The TA portal needs the latest data from the institutes, so it performs a web request in regular intervals, maybe once a day, as follows:
 
The TA portal application "opens" a certain URL on the institute's web site.
The web application of the institute returns all pieces of information (like expert, projects, and so on) as JSON formatted text.
 
An example of such a URL is
http://technology-assessment.info/run/json/sample
It shows a possible JSON output.
Please be aware that this is just a demo page. It does not contain any real data.

It is required that the web applications of the institutes offer such functionality to the TA portal web application.

That should be relatively easy, if the data are available in a database. 
Then the developers have to write a web page which accesses the database, gathers all required data, and represents them in the JSON format.

The data and the format of such a JSON page are defined in the data format specification.
You can find the latest version on
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsEN060Ilii4dFgxa1AzUnpXVTdFMWlIVTlXTVIwOVE
or in the TA portal forum area.

You can validate such JSON text on 
http://technology-assessment.info/run/json/tester
to see, if it is correct.

We provided a php program which "converts" some data (i. e. php objects) into JSON text.
If you write your web page in php, you are free to use the php classes we provide, to ease your task.
Then you only have to access the database, and store all relevant data in the according php objects.

For an example see FakedEntitiesMaker. 
Here some Expert, Institute, Publication, and Project objects are created and stored
in lists (like TheExperts, TheInstituts, ...). 
Then the JSONBuilder object is used to generate JSON output.

A php web page might look like:

<?php
/**
 * This is a small demo program which creates a few entities and
 * returns them as JSON formatted to the web browser.
 */

require_once 'taportal/institutes/webservice/base/Classes.php';

header( "Content-type: application/json; charset=ISO-8859-1" );
header( "Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit" );
header( 'Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate' );
header( 'Expires: Mon, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT' );

list( $institutes, $experts, $projects, $publications ) = FakedEntitiesMaker::fakeExample1();

echo JSONBuilder::build( $institutes, $experts, $projects, $publications );

?>

Of course, you will not use the FakedEntityMaker, but access the database and create some entities with real data.
